# Architecture

The high-level architecture diagram below illustrates the offline pipeline.

- `docs/architecture.mmd` contains the Mermaid source.
- `docs/architecture.html` renders the diagram.

You can open the HTML diagram directly if viewing the repo locally, or regenerate
it via `scripts/render_diagram.sh`.

```{note}
When building the Sphinx docs, the HTML diagram is included as a downloadable
artifact rather than embedded. Click the link below.
